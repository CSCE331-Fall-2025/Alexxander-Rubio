        Howdy, my name is Alexxander Rubio.  
        I am a Junior at <a href="https://www.tamug.edu/" target="_blank">Texas A&amp;M University Galveston</a> studying Computer Science.  
        My favorite part of coding is the creative aspects surrounding it, and being able to make something out of nothing with tangible results.  

        This is my first major project by myself and I've made it my goal to discover as much as I can within the short 3 weeks of making this website while managing my other courses and work.  

        I am aiming to learn as much as I can before I graduate so I have a wide variety of options and skills.  

        To say a little more about myself outside of Computer Science, I am also an RA/CL on campus and a previous TA.  

        In my free time, I play video games or <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> with my friends.  

        I also enjoy listening to music, my favorite bands being  
        <a href="https://dancegavindanceband.com/" target="_blank">Dance Gavin Dance</a>,  
        <a href="https://eidolaband.com/" target="_blank">Eidola</a>, and  
        <a href="https://www.normandieofficial.com/" target="_blank">Normandie</a>.
