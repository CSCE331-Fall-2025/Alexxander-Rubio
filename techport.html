        <h3>This Website with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a>/<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a>/<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>:</h3>
        <p>This website so far has been my super largest project. This is my first time doing any implementation for html/css/js and I'm glad I was able to learn
            as many features as I could, such as the lightning and switch mechanics, in just 3 weeks.</p>

        <h3>Tetris in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>:</h3>
        <p>I have improved and corrected tetris code using the language Ruby for a project.
            It included standard falling blocks with keyboard or mouse controls,
            but also supported extra features such as a cheat block that costed points.</p>

        <h3>A Language Interpreter in <a href="https://racket-lang.org/" target="_blank">Racket</a>:</h3>
        <p>I have used Racket to create a proper interpreter for a made up language MUPL. It handled basic operations such as addition and implemented broader topics such as recursion.</p>

        <h3>Small projects in <a href="https://isocpp.org/" target="_blank">C++</a>:</h3>
        <p>I have completed numerous small projects in C++, most notably a Dungeon Crawler, a working Card Game, and Graphing Problems with Dijkstra's Algorithm.</p>

        <h3>Data Manipulation and Graphing in <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>:</h3>
        <p>Some of the first projects I've done included reading and analyzing data trends using Python.</p>

        <h2>Future Projects:</h2>

        <h3>NASA Spacesuit User Interface Technology for Students <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/spacesuit-user-interface-technologies-for-students/" target="_blank">SUITS</a>:</h3>
        <p>I am now starting the SUITS 2025-2026 project with a team of TAMUG Computer Science students to work with search patterns and machine learning concepts for space rover navigations.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank">Machine Learning</a>:</h3>
        <p>It is not an official project, but one of the key concepts I plan to understand and be able to apply by the end of the year is basic fundamentals of how machines read data and learn from it.
            Having this knowledge is my main challenge for this semester as I transition to artificial intelligence.</p>
